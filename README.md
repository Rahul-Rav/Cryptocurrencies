# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. Here we create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The data we will worked with was not ideal, so it needed to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, it was decided that unsupervised learning would be the best model to use. To group the cryptocurrencies, we used a clustering algorithm. The findings from the data visualizations will be shared with the board.
